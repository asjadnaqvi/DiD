## Notes

- Based on: Arkhangelsky et. al. 2021. [Synthetic Difference-in-Differences](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190159). 
- Program version (if available): 2.0.2 June 28, 2024

## Installation

```stata
ssc install sdid, replace
```

Take a look at the help file:

```stata
help sdid
```

## Test the command

Please make sure that you generate the data using the script given [here](https://asjadnaqvi.github.io/DiD/docs/code/06_03_data/) 

```stata
sdid Y id t D, vce(bootstrap) seed(1000) 
```

Since we are using bootstrapped standard errors, we fix the seed for replicability. We get this output:


```stata
Bootstrap replications (50). This may take some time.

```

The command's built-in graph option gives us: 


```stata
sdid Y id year D, vce(bootstrap) seed(1000) graph
```


The command saves a set of graphs with prefix `g2_` that represent synthetic DiD graphs split by the year of the first treatment:

The weights used to average pre-treatment periods are shown as area fills at the bottom of the figures.
